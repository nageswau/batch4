flow control:
  1. conditional statements: if, elif and else 
  2. iterative statements: for, while
  3. transfer statements: break, continue, return, try, except
  
1. conditional statements:
    1. execute block of statements only if condition satisfies(if)
	    if condition:
		    statements
	
	2. execute block of statements if compound condition satisfies
	    if condition and/or condition2:
		   statements
	
	3. execute a block of statements if condition satisfies otherwise execute alternative     block of statements
	   if conditions:
	      statements
	   else:
	       alternative statements
	4. having multiple alternatives
	     if condition1:
		    statements
		 elif condition2:
		    first set of alternatives
		 else:
		   second set of alternatives
	4. execute block of statements based on nested conditions
	     if condition:
		   if condition:
		      if condition:
			     statements
